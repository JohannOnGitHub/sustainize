    <h1>Our reason
    </h1>
    <p>Although more are trying to be socially responsible, there is no efficient way to meet and find resources in the field. There are many platforms where people can connect and network, but they are filled with other topics making it nearly impossible to find relevant connections within sustainability. <br>We see the need of a place that will allow people to work, share, collaborate and learn from each other.
